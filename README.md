# LaborNeighbor
Capstone React Projec for Labor Neighbor

## Requirements for use
Must have nodejs installed in order to run the application. This can be downloaded at the [node site](https://nodejs.org/en/). Also need to include font awesome from npm. To do this, navigate to project directory and enter: "npm install --save font-awesome"

## Running the applictation on your machine
The first thing ou will need to do is clone the repo. To do this enter the terminal, cd to the directory you would like to store the project and perform a git clone. Once you have cloned the project you can start it. To do that you must navigate inside the labor-neighbor-app folder. You should see node_modules, public, another README that contains information on Create React App, src, and some json files. You can then enter nppm start into the terminal which will compile the project and run it in your browser.

## Working in the project
When you begin to work you will want to make sure you have the most recent version of the project by performing a git pull in the project directory. You can do this by navigating to the project folder (the same one you went to in order to start the project) and enter git pull in the terminal.

When you are done working you can commit work by navigating to the labor-neighbor-app folder and entering git commit in the terminal. You can perform multpiple commits, but when you are finished you should perform a git push in the terminal. This will update the project with your most recent changes.

## File Structure
The file structure is still a work in progress, but this is the most recent structure. The heart of the application lives in App.js. That is where the project will be put together. You must import all components before you can use them. The components will be stored in the Components folder and stylesheets will be stored in the Styling folder. Just like the components must be imported, the stylesheets must also be imported within the App.css file. Header and Footer templates have been made which should serve as very basic templates

## For Theresa
Open Terminal. Type "cd Desktop" then "cd LaborNeighbor" then "cd labor-neighbor-app". After that type "git pull" then "npm start" and you should see the most recent version of the project.
